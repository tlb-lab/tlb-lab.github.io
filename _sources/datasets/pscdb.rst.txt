PSCDB - Protein Structural Change Database
===========================================

The data contained with PSCDB is drawn from the Protein Structural Change Database [2] . The dataset consists of paired
protein structures in their bound and unbound forms across 7 classes of structural rearrangement motion. Several tasks
can be formulated with this dataset. E.g. predicting the bound conformation of a protein as and edge-prediction task or
graph-classification task predicting which class of structural rearrangement a protein undergoes upon ligand binding.
