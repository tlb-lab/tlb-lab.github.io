<h2>Constructing a graph for analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#Constructing-a-graph-for-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>First, we need a graph to work with. Here we construct a graph of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/3eiy">3EIY</a>, a pyrophosphatase. We use the following edges: * Hydrophobic Interactions * Aromatic Interactions * Disulfide Interactions * Peptide Bonds</p>
<p>Using DSSP, we add relative (RSA) and absolute solvent accessibility (ASA) to the nodes.</p>

<h2>Scatter Matrix<a class="headerlink" href="#Scatter-Matrix" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>We can use scatter matrices to correlate node-level graph metrics (e.g. centrality measures) with node features.</p>
<p>First, we will plot the scatter matrix for a selection of centrality measures and the relative solvent accessibility (RSA) and absolute solvent accessibility (ASA). <em>N.B.</em> we can include these features in the plot as we have added them as metadata in the initial graph construction. Refer to cell 2 at the top of this notebook for clarity.</p>
